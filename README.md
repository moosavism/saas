Running python3 train_on_random_labels.py trains network on random labels several times and saves the losses to .npy file. 

Then running python3 plot_fig1.py, you can get the plot in the paper. 


The results in the figure-1 are obtained by fixed learning rate of 0.1, with
no data augmentation or weight decay.
